<h4>Wordpress child themes built to unify the design of 'Appthemes' themes.<br />Feel free to use but please send <a href="http://paintmine.com">us</a> love.</h4>

This is part of a project to connect local small businesses with a series of useful web apps. We're using 'Appthemes' Wordpress themes as a base.

Each 'Apptheme' comes with its own unique style so we've decided to build a unified set of child themes, allowing developers to keep the same branding across multiple 'Appthemes'.

<strong>Please note:</strong> These are child themes only. To use these files you will also need the latest versions from the <a href="http://www.appthemes.com/">Appthemes website</a>.

So far we've nearly completed 'Vantage' and 'Classipress' childthemes. 'Clipper' is next on the list.
The final goal is to integrate each of these themes at a coding level (e.g. if you have a coupon attached to your business listing then it will display on the Vantage directory).

If this sounds like a worthy project please get stuck in.
