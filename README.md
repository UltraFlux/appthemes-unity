Wordpress child themes built to unify the design of 'Appthemes' themes. 
Please feel free to use but please send <a href="http://paintmine.com">us</a> love.
-------------------------------------

This is part of a project to connect local small businesses with a series of useful web apps. We're using 'Appthemes' Wordpress themes as a base.

As each of the themes comes with its own unique style we've decided to build a unified set of child themes, allowing developers to build and manage multiple 'Appthemes' themes and still keep the branding unified.

So far we've nearly completed 'Vantage' and 'Classipress' childthemes. 'Clipper' is next on the list
